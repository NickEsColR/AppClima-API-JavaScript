# Weather Searcher

Welcome to the Weather Searcher, a web application designed for retrieving weather information using the OpenWeather API.

## Project Overview

This project is inspired by the work of garu2, available at [AppClima-API-JavaScript](https://github.com/garu2/AppClima-API-JavaScript). I appreciate the foundational work that served as a starting point for our weather searcher.

## ðŸ’» Tutorial

Garu2 has prepared the project guide, which serves has template. This is available in a video tutorial format. Check out the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/-dWQ8E62cPU).

## Project Enhancements

I have made several enhancements to the original project, including:

* **Page Style:** Modify visual aesthetics for a better user experience.
* **Multiple Weather Cards:** Now you can add and view weather information for multiple locations.
* **Header and Footer:** Added a header and footer to enhance the overall structure and navigation of the web application.

Feel free to explore and utilize these modifications to enhance your weather searching experience.

### React usage

Another enhancement is the React library to make components reactive. Some of the hooks used are

* **useState** to allow re-rendering of components.

* **useRef** to allow the re-rendering of wetherCard component
