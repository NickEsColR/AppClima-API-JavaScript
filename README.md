## Project Overview

## Project Enhancements

I have made several enhancements to the original project, including:

* **Page Style:** Modify visual aesthetics for a better user experience.
* **Multiple Weather Cards:** Now you can add and view weather information for multiple locations.
* **Header and Footer:** Added a header and footer to enhance the overall structure and navigation of the web application.

Feel free to explore and utilize these modifications to enhance your weather searching experience.
